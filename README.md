# My Resume

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgsoverly/resume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tgsoverly/resume)

Compile HTML and Latex files from templates and data.  I figured a resume for stuff I do should also speak to at least some of the things I care about: repeatability and maintainability.  Those are good things to say in speeches where you wave your hands about how everyone "else" doesn't care about the "important" stuff.

The compiled html resume is [here](http://tgsoverly.github.io/resume/cv.html).

# Goals

1. Make it easy to have the same information in multiple formats, because copy/pasting haunts me.
1. Automatically deploy the results some place for people to find, because repeating stuff haunts me.

# TODOs

Still a work in progress because it really is just something that erks me and not something I need for a new job.

1. Get all the latex items into html templates
1. Migrate the original tex files to use tex templates
1. If latex fail, then the build should fail
