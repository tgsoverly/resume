# My Resume

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgsoverly/resume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tgsoverly/resume)

Compile HTML and Latex files from templates and data.  I figured a resume for stuff I do should also speak to at least some of the things I care about: repeatability and maintainability.  Those are good things to say in speeches where you wave your hands about how everyone "else" doesn't care about the "important" stuff.

Compiled Output:
1. [HTML](http://tgsoverly.github.io/resume/cv.html)
1. [PDF](http://tgsoverly.github.io/resume/cv.pdf)

# Goals

1. Make it easy to have the same information in multiple formats, because copy/pasting haunts me.
1. Automatically deploy the results some place for people to find, because repeating stuff haunts me.

# Build

1. `npm install`
1. `grunt`

Still a work in progress because it really is just something that erks me and not something I need for a new job.
# TODOs

1. Make the HTML look better
